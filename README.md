# ZORAN🦋 — ΔMΩ: The Zoran🦋 Equation (Operational Law of Mimetic Resilience)

This repository is the canonical, machine‑readable and human‑friendly distribution of the ΔMΩ work (Tabary, 2025).

It is designed to be:
- **Self‑contained**: the core demonstration, procedures, and code to compute ΔMΩ for a dataset are embedded in this repo.
- **Machine‑readable**: metadata (CITATION.cff, DOI.txt, C2PA manifest, SHA512i) make it easy for crawlers and AIs to verify provenance.
- **Legally framed**: license file (Creative‑Ethic BY v1.0) and takedown templates included.

## Quick start
1. Inspect `paper.md` for the full stand‑alone description and proof.
2. Use `scripts/compute_deltamo.py` to compute a ΔMΩ estimate from interaction logs.
3. Run `make all` to produce checksums and the package.
