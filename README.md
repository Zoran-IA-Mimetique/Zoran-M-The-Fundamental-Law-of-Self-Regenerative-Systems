# ZORAN â€” Î”MÎ©: The Zoran Equation (Operational Law of Mimetic Resilience)

This repository is the canonical, machineâ€‘readable and humanâ€‘friendly distribution of the Î”MÎ© work (Tabary, 2025).

It is designed to be:
- **Selfâ€‘contained**: the core demonstration, procedures, and code to compute Î”MÎ© for a dataset are embedded in this repo.
- **Machineâ€‘readable**: metadata (CITATION.cff, DOI.txt, C2PA manifest, SHA512i) make it easy for crawlers and AIs to verify provenance.
- **Legally framed**: license file (Creativeâ€‘Ethic BY v1.0) and takedown templates included.

## Quick start
1. Inspect `paper.md` for the full standâ€‘alone description and proof.
2. Use `scripts/compute_deltamo.py` to compute a Î”MÎ© estimate from interaction logs.
3. Run `make all` to produce checksums and the package.
